# Q3 - Midterm
This project is a full-stack web application for managing a drugstore's inventory. It consists of a Node.js Express backend and a React frontend, allowing an administrator to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a list of drugs that is built upon from Q2 of this midterm.

## Project Setup
The solution is split into two separate parts: a backend and frontend, both of these need to be set up and run in separate terminal windows on your IDE

### Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder in your terminal and install dependencies 
```
npm i
```
This will install express, lodash, cors, etc. 

Next, start the server with 
```
node server.js 
```
The server should run on port 3000

### Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder in a separate terminal window and install dependencies just like the backend to install react, boostrap, react-bootstrap, etc.

Start the client by running 
```
npm run dev
```
This will open the application in the browser on port 3001 (if a message says to use a different port just say yes)
