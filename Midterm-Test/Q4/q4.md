With Next.js, SSR means the HTML for a page is generated on the server at the time of each request using 'getServerSideProps'. Something like this is good for when data changes frequently. If I was making a news app or stock app, I would use this. On the other hand SSG is used when HTML is only to be built ONCE at build time using 'getStaticProps'. This is a fast, cached method but only updates on rebuilds. This is good for content that doesnt change often like a product page. CSR is when the browser loads MOSTLY empty HTML, and JS fills in the blanks in the data after the page loads. SSR gives new data but is slower than SSG, but SSG is the fastest but it isnt in real-time. CSR is the most dynamic but bad for SEO raw. 

export default function ProductsSSR({ products }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products (SSR)</h1>
      <ul>
        {products.map((product) => (
          <li key={product.id}>
            {product.title} — ${product.price}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

// Runs at *every* request
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products');
  const products = await res.json();

  return { props: { products } };
}

  return (

        {products.map((product) => (
          <li key={product.id}>

          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

//runs at build time or intervals
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://fakestoreapi.com/products');
  const products = await res.json();

  return {
    props: { products },
    revalidate: 60, //interval to rebuild every 60 seconds
  };
}
